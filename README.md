# Java Code Practices

There are 3 modules in this repository which I play around with these topics:
- Date Time API
- Java8 Practices
- Serializable Examples

## Date Time API
I decided to develop this module when I saw that I want to improve my API design skills. Then I remembered code katas technique
from some articles and Java champion [Ozcan Acar](https://github.com/ozcanacar). In order to, I found myself in the middle of the api design investigation. This research
helped me where I can start from. [Java 8 Date Time API](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/package-summary.html). Yes! It could be applied as a Code Kata. 

#### How will you be sure the implementation won't be messy?

I develop this API every day and may make wrong in implementations of Date Time API. But I can say it wouldn't be a problem,
because I compare my code and Java8 Date Time API codes in the course of time.

## Java8 practices
This module contains Java8 features and there's a plan to keep up to date this module.

## Serializable Examples
This module is about serializable and contains examples.
